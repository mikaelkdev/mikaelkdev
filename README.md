## About Me

I am Mikael Koskinen, a passionate full-stack web developer from Finland with a strong academic background in Computer Science. My main focus is developing modern, responsive, and scalable web applications using cutting-edge technologies. With a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Helsinki, I have gained deep insights into both theoretical and practical aspects of software development. My expertise lies in frontend frameworks like React and Vue.js, as well as backend technologies such as Node.js and Django.

I am a strong advocate of clean code, software design patterns, and best practices in both frontend and backend development. In addition to my professional work, I am an active contributor to open-source projects, constantly improving my skills and learning from the global developer community.
